# Crick Click

In Sri Lanka, there are plenty of cricketers who play matches all over the island which are not considered national matches and there are some talented players among them that do not get a chance to rise to the national level. Especially in rural areas, there are very few chances to earn recognition as a cricket player. This software is trying to find the solution for that while giving players and match organizers to use the software as a Scoreboard. The software is developed as a website to display the live cricket scoreboard across the internet for any cricket match conducted in Sri Lanka.
